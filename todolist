step 1:
learn static variables.
function prototyped

-submit 2 files
	get_next_line.c get_next_line.h
-5 function max, read malloc free
-use your libft
-check for memory leaks
-author file
/
-write a function that returns a line from read from a fd
line to '\n' or EOF

int		get_next_line(const int fd, char **line)

-first parameter is the fd that will be used to read
-2nd parameter is the address of a pointer to a character that will be used to
	save the line read from the file descriptor.
- return value:
	1  = a line has read
	0  = read is done
	-1 = error occured
- function must return its result without \n
- get_next_line.h: prototype the function get_next_line.
	include macro that allows you to choose the size of the reading buffer for read
	#define BUFF_SIZE 32
